```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)


theme_set(theme_minimal()+theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colur = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

```

## Problem 1

Read in the data. 

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  view

```

Let's look at this a bit.
