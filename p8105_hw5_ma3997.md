Hello\! And welcome to my solutions for Homework 5. Enjoy.

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit.

``` r
aggregrate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  ) 
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregrate_df %>% filter(city_state =="Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregrate_df %>% filter(city_state =="Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

R spits out statistical info in a format that’s hard to extract.
Broom::tidy gives that info in a nice tibble

Try to iterate…..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregrate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~ prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Map2 lets you map over two elements at the same time

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsolved...
  n_total...
  prop.test(...)
}

homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ##   victim_race = col_character(),

  tibble(
    path = list.files("data/lda_data")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(

The experimental arm seems to have a positive trend over the course of
the weeks while the control arm seems to generally stay the same.

  sim_df =

    )

As effect sizes increase, power significantly increases.

The sample means are approximately equal to the true mean which is as
expected given the large sample size. Filtering by estimates that are
statistically significant provides estimates that are also approximately
equal to the true means which also makes sense since we are only viewing
sample means that are not equal to zero.
